# Snake-Game
Welcome to the Snake Game repository! This project is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game using Python. The game provides a fun and interactive experience where players control a snake and try to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the boundaries and the snake's own body.


## How to Play

1. The game window will appear with a snake and food displayed.

2. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right).

3. Guide the snake to eat the food to increase its length and score.

4. Avoid collisions with the boundaries and the snake's own body. If the snake collides, the game will end.

5. Try to achieve the highest score possible and challenge your friends!

## Controls

- Up Arrow Key: Move the snake upwards.
- Down Arrow Key: Move the snake downwards.

- Right Arrow Key: Move the snake to the right.
